Airport Challenge - in JS!
=================
We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

User Stories:

```

As an air traffic controller

As an air traffic controller

I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
```

Limitations:
------
* We timeboxed ourselves to spend a maximum of four hours on this project whilst familiarising ourselves with Javascript for the first time. This is by no means a finished product
* Missing feature tests
* Should've 'spied' on object interactions (over and above weather stub)
* Edge cases
